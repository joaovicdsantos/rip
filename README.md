# RIP (Refresh IP)

Another utility for refreshing your IP address using the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) service for Linux.

**The RIP will not install Tor if it is not installed.**

# Todo

- [ ] Add flags to define the timeout and interval of the refresh
- [ ] Improve HTTP request to verify the current IP
- [ ] Add a flag to verify the init system (systemd, runit, openrc...) to handle the Tor service
